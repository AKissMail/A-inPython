# Set up for the programm. It can solve all task from 1 to task To do so you need to set a task number in the variable
# task. The Path to the map has to be stored in the variable path_to_map.
# @param int task: between 1 and 4
# @param string path_to_map: the path to the map. The map should be present as a csv file.
